                    <h4>MADEISD: 7th Workshop on Modern Approaches in Data Engineering and Information System Design</h4>
                    <h3>Short description</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">For decades, in many, particularly complex organization systems, there is an open issue how to support information management process so as to produce useful knowledge and tangible business values from data being collected. Database and information systems still play one of the central roles in addressing aforementioned issue. Today we have a huge selection of various technologies, tools, and methods in data engineering as a discipline that helps in a support of the whole data life cycle in organization systems, as well as in information system design that supports the software process in data engineering. Despite that, one of the hot issues in practice is still how to effectively transform large amounts of daily collected operational data into the useful knowledge from the perspective of declared company goals, and how to set up the information design process aimed at production of effective software services in companies. The main goal of this workshop is to address open questions and real potentials for various applications of modern approaches and technologies in data engineering and information system design so as to develop and implement effective software services in a support of information management in various organization systems. We intend to address interdisciplinary character of a set of theories, methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies in disciplines such as Data Engineering, Information System Design, Big Data, NoSQL Systems, Data Streams, Internet of Things, Cloud Systems, and Model Driven Approaches in a development of effective software services. We invite researchers from all over the world who will present their contributions, interdisciplinary approaches or case studies related to modern approaches in Data Engineering and Information System Design. We express an interest in gathering scientists and practitioners interested in applying these disciplines in industry sector, as well as public and government sectors, such as healthcare, education, public administration, or security services. Experts from all sectors and application domains are welcomed. <br> <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://madeisd.fon.bg.ac.rs/2025.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://madeisd.fon.bg.ac.rs/2025.html</a></p>

                    <h3>Short description</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">DOING workshop focuses on transforming data into information and then into knowledge. The idea is to gather researchers in NLP (Natural Language Processing), DB (Databases), and AI (Artificial Intelligence) to discuss two main problems : (1) how to extract information from textual data and represent it in knowledge bases; (2) how to propose intelligent methods for handling and maintaining these databases with new forms of requests, including efficient, flexible, and secure analysis mechanisms, adapted to the user, and with quality and privacy preservation guarantees. This workshop focuses on all aspects concerning these modern infrastructures, giving particular attention (but not limited to) to data related to health and environmental domains. <br> <strong>Website:</strong><a href="https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/doing/?page_id=1334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/doing/?page_id=1334</a></p>

                    <h4>K-GALS: 4th Workshop on Knowledge Graphs Analysis on a Large Scale</h4>
                        <h3>Short description</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">Knowledge graphs are powerful models to represent networks of real-world entities, such as objects, events, situations, concepts, by illustrating the relationships between them. Information encoded by knowledge graphs is usually stored in graph databases, and visualized as graph structures. Although these models have been introduced in the Semantic Web context, they have recently found successful applications also in other contexts, e.g., the analysis of financial, social, geospatial and biomedical data. Knowledge graphs often integrate datasets from various sources, which frequently differ in their structure. This, together with the increasing volumes of structured and unstructured data stored in a distributed manner, bring to light new problems related to data/knowledge representation and integration, data querying, business analysis and knowledge discovery. The ultimate goal of this workshop is to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce and discuss new methods, theoretical approaches, algorithms, and software tools that are relevant to the Knowledge Graphs based research, especially when it is focused on a large scale. To this regard, interesting open issues include how Knowledge Graphs may be used to represent knowledge, how systems managing Knowledge Graphs work, and which applications may be provided on top of a Knowledge Graph, in the distributed.

                    <h4>CAIMA: 1st Workshop on Cooperative AI Models and Applications</h4>
                    <h3>Short description</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">The CAIMA Workshop centers on Cooperative AI, an approach grounded in Martin Hollis’s concept of we-rationality, which suggests that in complex ecosystems, individuals should not act solely based on personal benefit but rather as contributors to a collective good. This idea is particularly relevant in AI, where different types of agents must interact—whether through human-AI collaboration, AI-AI coordination, or AI-environment adaptation—to achieve shared goals. Topics include Active Learning (expert-guided model training), eXplainable AI (enhancing user understanding), Neuro-symbolic AI (hybrid reasoning systems), Federated Learning (coordinated agent evolution), and Reinforcement Learning (reward-based adaptation). A key focus is sustainability, aligning AI development with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by promoting energy-efficient models and reducing bias. The workshop provides a forum to explore novel theories, methods, tools, and applications for interaction-driven AI systems. <br> <strong>Website: </strong><a href="https://events.dimes.unical.it/caima-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://events.dimes.unical.it/caima-2025</a></p>

                    <h4>ERGA: International Workshop on Entity Resolution and Graph Alignment</h4>
                        <h3>Short description</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">In the era of a connected world and abundant data, entity resolution and graph alignment have come to play an increasingly important role for ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and quality. Entity resolution identifies and links records referring to the same real-world entities (e.g., people, organizations) despite inconsistencies and has been a cornerstone of data integration with applications in finance, healthcare and various other domains. Graph alignment maps nodes and edges across different graphs taking into account the relationships
                            and structures between the entities with applications such as social network analysis, bioinformatics and knowledge graphs. Both of these tasks share common challenges, particularly in handling large-scale data, requiring efficient solutions and deploying techniques from a great variety of research areas such as database management, big data and parallel processing, machine learning and AI-based techniques, and others. Recognizing the common ground between entity resolution and graph alignment, the goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers, practitioners and experts in both fields to introduce new methods and techniques, discuss open challenges, and explore future research directions. The workshop aims to facilitate the exchange of new ideas in each of the two fields, while also highlighting their shared goals and providing new opportunities for collaborations.

                    <h4>FEHDA: Fairness Exploration in Heterogeneous Data and Algorithms</h4>
                    <h3>Short description</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">Fairness is a complex and multifaceted concept that has garnered increasing attention in many computer science research areas. Defining and measuring fairness is often context-dependent, as different applications may require tailored approaches to address specific ethical concerns. Understanding the relationships between involved groups can be facilitated by defining an ontology or identifying key properties. However, achieving fairness demands ongoing evaluations, transparent decision-making, and adaptability to evolving contexts. A key challenge in achieving fairness is managing heterogeneous data from diverse sources, formats, and structures. Another important aspect is ensuring fairness through the careful design and evaluation of algorithms at all stages—pre-processing, modeling, and post-processing—to mitigate biases and promote equity in data-driven systems. We welcome articles with a particular focus on descriptive ontologies, fairness metrics, and properties, as well as frameworks for managing data heterogeneity to ensure fairness, and fairness-aware algorithms. We are also open to discussing other fair-related topics that are not explicitly mentioned. <br> <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/fehda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sites.google.com/view/fehda</a></p>
