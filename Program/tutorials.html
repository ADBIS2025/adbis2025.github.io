                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">In today's data-driven world, ensuring data quality has become the key to success for organizations across industries and academia. Hence, this tutorial begins by exploring the foundational principles of data quality, emphasizing dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and validity. We will dive into strategies for identifying and addressing common data quality issues, including data duplication, missing values, and errors in data entry or processing. However, many strategies for improving data quality are costly in terms of processing time, computational resources, and/or the needed amount of training data. Furthermore, applied heuristic methods return suboptimal results.
                        Current quantum computing research explores whether these types of computational challenges could benefit from quantum computers. Quantum computing is rapidly emerging as a transformative technology, marked by recent breakthroughs and a potentially revolutionary computational paradigm. Although it is still in its early stages, improved quantum hardware, growing global awareness, and investments underscore its potential to transform various industries.
                        This tutorial will briefly introduce quantum computing and focus on its applications to data quality, including quantum machine learning. We will discuss the potential of quantum computing and show use cases utilizing quantum machine learning and quantum optimization for data quality issues. We will also point out open challenges that might open new research directions and new business opportunities in improving data quality.</p>

                    <h1>A hands-on tutorial exploring epistemic influence, intellectual history, and data justice through interdisciplinary graph analysis</h1>
                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">This tutorial invites data and computer scientists to step
beyond conventional technical challenges and engage with questions of
epistemic justice. Participants will apply tools like NLP, graph analytics,
and embeddings to culturally complex datasets—such as Wikipedia
entries and literary corpora from Latin America and Eastern Europe.
Through hands-on exercises, they will explore how data science can be
used to surface epistemic violence, recognize marginalized contributions
to knowledge, and support decolonial approaches to information systems.</p>

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">Multi-modal data processing is about exploring the interactions
between various types of data to produce a more comprehensive or
accurate understanding of a phenomenon such as health, emotions, or circumstances.
Vectors as data representation methods have emerged as an
important component in modern data management, driven by the growing
importance for the need to computationally describe multi-modal
data such as texts, images and video in various domains. In this tutorial,
we provide a fundamental introduction on vector representations of
multi-modal data, which includes intra-modal representation and intermodal
representation. The goal of our tutorial is to provide a centralized
and condensed introduction regarding theories and applications of multimodal
data vectorization technologies for both database researchers and
practitioners. We also discuss how to use vector database management
systems for the management of multi-modal data.</p>

<h4 id="t4">Tutorial 4 - Data Warehousing: The Industrial Perspective <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">(2-hour tutorial)</span></h4>

                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">Like with many other concepts, the theoretical ideas regarding how
data warehouses should be organized are rarely followed in real-life systems. The
notion of data warehouses as storage for historical, rarely or never changing records
used for summary reports, slicing and dicing, and trend analysis do not reflect
the most common business needs. In this tutorial, we will closely examine
existing business demands and discuss how to support them.

In this tutorial, we are going to discuss the data warehousing industry needs and whether
these needs are covered by existing commercial offerings. We will outline some known
challenges and discuss how new research could address them. We want to convince
attendees that data warehouses are more complicated than they are usually thought of
and are therefore interesting as a source of research problems.</p>
