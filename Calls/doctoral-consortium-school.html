                    <h3>About</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">
                        The ADBIS 2025 Doctoral Consortium School (DCS), co-located with the ADBIS 2025 conference, will take place in person, between the 23rd and 26th of September 2025 at the Tampere University. It will consist of tutorials and research talks covering state-of-the-art research projects and future challenges, and a Poster Session. In the Poster Session all participants will have a chance to showcase their Phd/Postdoc research topic and results (or their Master’s thesis topic, in case they are still in the Master’s degree), and get feedback from the experts present at the event.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The DCS serves as a valuable platform to bring together early-stage research students and international experts in Database Management and Information Systems for a multi-day event. It is committed to:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Educate on state-of-the-art topics in Data Management and Data Science, covering relevant topics that range from the design principles behind data-intensive applications, through data integration and management within big data platforms, down to the empowerment of databases and analytical processing with the latest findings in the field of artificial intelligence.</li>
                      <li>Act as a networking hub, providing ample opportunities for students to exchange experiences with each other and to discuss in a friendly, collegial setting with the expert speakers at the event.</li>
                      <li>Facilitate career planning discussions, focusing on designing a professional career project tailored to individual goals and considering current and future opportunities in academia and industry. This includes exploring the evolving landscape of the technology sector, researching and developing, and understanding how market dynamics and economic trends influence career paths. Participants will gain insights into aligning their aspirations with broader industry demands, helping them make informed decisions about their professional futures in a rapidly changing environment. They will have practical sessions on technical writing, text typesetting, slide preparation, technical talk preparation, and public speaking. Also, participants will discuss the virtues and limitations of research vs. industry career is envisaged.</li>
                  </ul>
                    The DCS will feature the <strong>Research Innovation Sprint</strong>, a dynamic and interactive activity designed to foster collaboration and innovation among young researchers. Developed across the four days, participants will form diversified teams, develop original research ideas, and refine their vision with guidance from expert mentors. The experience culminates in a pitch session, where teams present their concepts and receive constructive feedback from their peers.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Day 1: Finding Common Ground. Participants will be subdivided into groups based on their expertise and research interests.</li>
                            <li>Day 2: From Concept to Collaboration. Teams will engage in a brainstorming activity to identify a joint research opportunity and draft an initial pitch outlining their collaborative research idea.</li>
                            <li>Day 3: Mentorship. Teams will receive expert feedback from senior researchers and mentors.</li>
                            <li>Day 4: The Grand Pitch. Teams will deliver their pitch presentations to peers and mentors and exchange constructive feedback.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                    By bringing together a diverse community, the event aims to inspire new ideas, promote cross-disciplinary interaction, and create opportunities for networking and mentorship. Importantly, it does so in a deeply respectful way and inclusive of all participants, ensuring that everyone feels valued and welcomed.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                        The DCS is committed to ensuring an inclusive, equal and diverse environment with zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or any other form of misconduct. To support Database education and research internationally, we will also provide discounted participation fees (see next section on Costs).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Application Process and Costs</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-align-last: left;">
                        The Doctoral Consortium School (DCS) will accept around 20-30 participants – they will be selected by the organizers from the applicants based on their academic progress and match of research topics/interests. Every participant will be expected to attend the in-person event and thus we encourage an early application. We encourage applications from PhD students whose research studies meet the broad area of data management and align with the scope of ADBIS, which includes Database Management Systems, Information Systems, Big Data Analytics, Scalable and Responsible Data Science. Master students and postdocs are also welcome to register subject to availability.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The DCS will have two types of participation fees: Full Fee 480€ and Reduced Fee 300€. There is only a limited supply of Reduced Fee registrations available. The participation fee includes coffee breaks and lunch served all days, and a gala dinner as part of the DCS. In addition to the participation fee, the selected participants are expected to pay for their lodging and travel expenses to Tampere. The city has many hotels and guesthouses for different budgets; we estimate per-night costs to be in the range of 80€-150€. Hostels are available as well from 30€ per-night.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>
                            Applicants must provide i) a CV (with optional publication list), ii) a description of their experience/knowledge about their research topic, and iii) a short motivation of how the DCS will benefit them in their studies/research.
                        </strong>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        All applications will be reviewed by the DCS organizers to select participants and assign reduced fees. Applicants will finally be notified and asked to proceed with the payment in case of acceptance. Rejected applicants may be re-contacted at a later stage if new slots become available.

      <h3>Data Quality in the Age of AI</h3>
      <p>Data quality comprises a large set of dimensions, covering many facets including simple statistics, syntactic problems, factual errors, and organizational and business aspects. With the current trend in data-oriented sciences and the increasing reliance on machine learning methods and AI systems, the challenges of poor data quality are ever more apparent. Even recent legislation, such as the EU AI Act, mentions data quality requirements for training data. With it, the notion of data quality extends to novel dimensions, such as fairness, diversity, or explainability. In the talk we shall highlight research in this field and point out current challenges and research opportunities.</p>             
      <h3>Data Profiling - a Primer</h3>
      <p>Data profiling is the act of extracting many different types of metadata from a given dataset. This research area has recently thrived, due to (i) its simple problem statements, such as "discover all key candidates", (ii) the high computational complexity of the problems, which are often exponential in the number of columns, (iii) the manifold opportunities for optimizations, such as apriori-inspired pruning or data sampling, and (iv) the various application areas for data profiling results, such as query optimization and data cleaning. In the talk, we will first cover the traditional problem statements and use cases and then highlight algorithmic intuitions of some solutions. Finally, we discuss open problems and promising research directions, for both data profiling and its use cases.</p>

      <h3>Diversity-Aware, Fair and Unbiased Data Management</h3>
      <p>As AI algorithms are increasingly deployed in domains that profoundly impact human lives, concerns about their fairness and transparency have become more pressing. Recently, significant attention has been directed towards the interconnection of explainability and fairness to advance responsible AI systems. Despite this growing interest, the relationship between these two concepts remains underexplored. In this talk, I will share our recent research on leveraging post-hoc explainability methods to detect and understand the root causes of biases in algorithmic outputs. Additionally, I will discuss the role of explainability in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and highlight opportunities for data-driven research in this critical area.</p>

      <h3>Digital Humanities on the Semantic Web: from Infrastructure to Practical Applications, AI-based Knowledge Discovery, and Web of Wisdom</h3>
      <p>Publishing Cultural Heritage (CH) data and Digital Humanities (DH) has evolved in phases from text carving and handwriting to printing texts, to publishing texts on-line, to publishing FAIR linked data comprehensible to computers for data enrichment and analysis, and to AI-based knowledge discovery on the Web, a “Web of Wisdom” [1]. In this keynote, lessons learned are overviewed on developing a national Semantic Web infrastructure [2] and over 20 in-use systems based on it with up to millions of end users during 2002-2024 [3]. The underlying linked data in these applications include museum collections, bibliographical data in libraries, medieval and renaissance manuscripts, military history, biographies, narratives, historical letter data, archaeological finds, legislation, parliamentary speeches, and art. Targeted to Digital Humanities researchers, application developers, and the public, these systems contain a Linked Open Data (LOD) service with a live SPARQL endpoint that can be used with modest programming skills for DH research, and a ready-to-use semantic portal on top of it. This work has led into the so-called Sampo Model for creating and publishing CH Knowledge Graphs (KG) as LOD services and semantic portal User Interfaces (UI).</p>

      <h3>Interactive Digital Storytelling</h3>
      <p>As the modern extension of the ancient practice of storytelling, digital storytelling relies on the use of multimedia assets to convey different types of stories. It has been used broadly as a term to cover a range of digital narratives from web-based stories to hypertexts, narrative computer games and even filmmaking. As a characteristic example, digital storytelling, or more generally story experiencing, has been established as an effective means of promoting visitor engagement in cultural sites, with significant potential to promote reflection and meaning making. This talk will present different approaches for story-centric experience design, focusing also on the role of agency, sociality, and personalization when combined with an interactive digital narrative. The application of interactive digital storytelling in different contexts and with a variety of technological solutions, from mobile-based or web technologies to desktop or immersive VR, has produced valuable insight as to the most effective use of novel technologies to engineer engagement.</p>

    <h3>Vector database management systems</h3>
    <p>Vector databases are a critical component in modern system infrastructures. In this study, we discuss the principles behind vector database management systems, with a focus on their features, the concept of vector embeddings, and similarity search mechanisms. Furthermore, we examine the synergies between vector databases and language models, which rely on vector embeddings for semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation. We also discuss the challenges arising from the integration of language models with vector databases. Through this discussion, we aim to provide PhD students and early-stage researchers with an overview of the integration of vector databases and language models.</p>
